# Notification library via email using phpMailer

This library has the function of sending e-mail using the **phpMailer** library. Doing this in an uncomplicated way is essential for any system.

To install the library, run the following command:

```sh
composer require dhelly/notification
```

To use the library, simply request the composer autoload, invoke the class and call the method:

```sh
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

USE Notification\Email;

$email = new Email(2, "mail.host.com", "your@email.com", "your-pass", "smtp secure (tls/ssl)", "port (587)",
    "from@email.com", "From Name");

$email->sendEmail("SUbject", "Content", "reply@email.com", "Replay Name", "address@email.com", "Address Name");
```

Note that the entire configuration of sending the email is using the magic method builder! Once the builder method has been invoked within your application, your system will be able to take the shots.
